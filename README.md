mySQL database for grocery data collection and analysis 

### Description 
The purpose of this project is to collect data and uncover trends regarding my home grocery shopping. I have a mySQL database into which I enter store, trip, and item information. The goal is to use this database to extract insights on how to shop in a most cost-effective and nutrient-rich manner. 

The inspiration for this project comes from my years as a professional cook. In a restaurant setting, food and labor costs are of prime importance in assessing the health of the business. I am applying this same outlook to my personal consumption habits.
