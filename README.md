# grocery-db
mySQL database for grocery data collection and analysis 

### Description 
The purpose of this project is to collect data and uncover trends regarding my home grocery shopping. I have a mySQL database into which I enter store, trip, and item information. The goal is to use this database to extract insights on how to shop in a most cost-effective and nutrient-rich manner. 

The inspiration for this project comes from my years as a professional cook. In a restaurant setting, food and labor costs are of prime importance in assessing the health of the business. I am applying this same outlook to my personal consumption habits. 

### Research Questions 

* What is the time frame of this data collected ? 
    September 2023 - February 2024 

* Costco vs. Winco 
What is the average price per trip at each store ?

* What is the most purchased item? 
* Could I use an LLM to help me categorize every item (categories: produce, dairy, meat, sundries, etc ?)

* Could I create a grocery template list from this data, i.e. the 20 most frequently purchased items? 

* What do I buy, and from where do I buy it ?
